# Software-Design-Document

# Summary
The Gaming Room was a client looking to expand their existing android app to other systems to get more users. They wanted me to design archietecure to support the server side development of their application.

# What Was Good
I think I did the domain and architeure overviews very well, as well as the breakdown of the choices of development tools and operating systems.

# Process Comments
I found the whole document very helpful, planning out the code in advance and knowing where the code is going to go really helped me create the actual code.

# Wishful Revisions
I would revise the recommendations part, as I would go into more depth as I feel I barely scratched the surface.

# Interpeting User Needs
I interperted the user's needs by reading their specs and desiging too it. It's very important to consdier the user's needs because they are the ones who the program is for, not me the programmer.

# Software Design Approach
I approached this from an academic viewpoint, trying to create the best software on paper and most of these stratedgies would be useful in the future.
